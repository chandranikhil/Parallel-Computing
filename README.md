# Parallel-Computing

This repository consists of programs that implement Parallel Computing Algorithms as a part of my coursework.<br>
All the algorithms have been implemented in Java <br>

To get an insight into how the algorithms work please refer to the book I followed
<ul>
<li><i>M.J. Quinn- Parallel Computing â€“ Theory and Practice</i>
</ul>

The following is the list of algorithms implemented
<ul>
<li>Enumeration Sort
<li>Graph Coloring
<li>Parallel Merge Sort
<li>Finding Prime Numbers using Sieve of Eratosthenes
<li>Prefix Sum
<li>List Ranking
</ul>
